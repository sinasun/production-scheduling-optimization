## Overview

Optimize your production scheduling with precision and efficiency. Our Production Scheduling Optimizer is a Java-based project that empowers you to streamline resource allocation, minimize production time, and meet deadlines with ease.

## Features

- **Task Allocation**: Assign tasks to employees based on type, availability, and constraints.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Optimize production schedules dynamically with advanced algorithms.
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Monitor task progress, dependencies, and priority levels in real-time.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess schedule performance, ensuring tasks meet due dates.
- **Output Generation**: Create output schedule files for sharing and in-depth analysis.

- [ ] Implement and document the Genetic Algorithms.
- [ ] Implement and document the Simulated Annealing algorithm.
- [ ] Implement and document the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.
- [ ] Implement and document the Greedy Algorithms.
- [ ] Implement and document the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach.

## Scheduling Algorithms

Our Production Scheduling Optimizer incorporates a range of cutting-edge algorithms, including:

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolve task assignments to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.
- **Simulated Annealing**: Explore the solution space for high-quality schedules.
- **Ant Colony Optimization**: Imitate the foraging behavior of ants for optimal scheduling.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Make locally optimal choices at each step for efficient schedules.
- **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: Model and solve complex scheduling problems for optimal solutions.

Choose the algorithm that best fits your production scheduling needs and witness the transformation of your supply chain.
